2) What is BigO notation?

Tthis is measurement of algorithms complexity, where resulted function grow not faster then original function. Funcitons measure time/memory costs of algorithm. Absicssa of a function is a amount of input data. Described worst case.

3) What is Tetta ?

The same lke BigO notation but from top and bottom of original function

4) What is Omega?

The same like BigO, but from bottom. 

5) Different type of complexities

Worst - when resource costs are maximum
Average - average case of input data, random for example
Best - minumum of

6) Implement quick sort, write complexities

7) Implement buble sort, write complexities

8) Implement heap sort, write complexities

9) Implement merge sort, write complexities

10) Implement inject sorting
